This repository is my personal portfolio of Python projects, the bulk of which are assignments from the Coursera Applied
Data Science with Python specialization via the University of Michigan.

Through this course and these projects, I have hands-on experience with Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikitlearn, and
other fundamental data science concepts in Python.  Please see the README file for individual projects (and/or the .py
files themeselves) for additional information.

Projects that may be of interest:

--Comparison of Michigan Cross-Country Times:  For this project, the only requirements given were that the final result
must include an informative visualization (using matplotlib) in some way pursuant to athletics in the state of Michigan.
I selected the topic, researched and cleaned the data sets, and presented visual evidence for my conclusion without any
other guidance.

--Predicting Property Maintenance Fines:  A supervised machine learning algorithm involving real-world data sets and
training a Random Forest classifier.
